ðŸŽ¯ Voice Distance and Object Detection
This project combines real-time object detection, approximate distance estimation, and voice alerts into a single application. 
It uses a TensorFlow-based custom-trained model to detect objects from a webcam feed, estimates how close they are, and plays audio warnings when they're too near.

ðŸš€ Features
Object detection from webcam video (e.g., cars, people)

Lane or line detection using Hough Transform

Approximate distance calculation

Audio alerts in Turkish using gTTS when objects are too close

ðŸ›  Requirements
Python 3

TensorFlow >= 1.10

OpenCV

gTTS

pygame

PIL (Pillow)

ðŸ“¦ Model Files
Make sure the following files are in place:

frozen_inference_graph.pb inside the inference_graph folder

labelmap.pbtxt inside the training folder

ðŸ’¡ Notes
This project was supported by TÃœBÄ°TAK 2209-A program in Turkey and was presented as a conference paper at two different conferences.
